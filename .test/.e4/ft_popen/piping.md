Of course. It's an excellent question. The flow of file descriptors in this scenario can indeed be tricky to follow. Let's break it down with a graphical representation and address the timing of these operations.

### Understanding the Sequence of Events

To answer your last question first: **everything is not happening simultaneously**. The operations within the parent and child processes happen in a sequence, but the parent and child processes themselves run concurrently after the `fork()` call.

Here's a breakdown of the typical execution flow:

1.  **`pipe(p)`:** The parent process executes this first.
2.  **`fork()`:** The parent process creates a child. From this moment on, two processes are running concurrently. The operating system's scheduler decides which process gets CPU time at any given moment.
3.  **Parent vs. Child Logic:** Both processes will immediately execute the code following the `fork()` call, but they will take different paths based on the return value of `fork()`.
    *   The **parent** will execute its `else` block.
    *   The **child** will execute its `if (pid == 0)` block.
4.  **Race Conditions:** While the operations *within* each process happen in the order they are written, the relative speed of the parent and child processes is not guaranteed. However, the logic is designed to work correctly regardless of which process runs first after the fork. For example, the parent can `close(p)` before or after the child `dup2`s it; the outcome is the same.

### Graphical Representation for 'r' (Read) Mode

Let's visualize the state of the file descriptors at each critical step.

#### Step 1: Before `ft_popen` is called

The parent process has its standard file descriptors: 0 (STDIN), 1 (STDOUT), and 2 (STDERR).

```
Parent Process
+---------------------------------+
| File Descriptors                |
|  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input   |
|  1 (STDOUT) -> Terminal Output  |
|  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output  |
+---------------------------------+
```

#### Step 2: Inside `ft_popen`, after `pipe(p)`

```c
	if (pipe(p) == -1)  // create pipe:       read p[0] --- p[1] write
		return (-1);    //                     pipe out <<< pipe in
```

The `pipe(p)` call creates a pipe. \
If pipe creation fails `-1` is returned. \
If pipe creation successful, the `p` array  variable is set in the parent process to the two new file descriptors. Let's assume they are `3` and `4`. So, `p[0]` is 3 (the read end) and `p[1]` is 4 (the write end).

```
Parent Process
+---------------------------------+
| File Descriptors                |
|  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input   |
|  1 (STDOUT) -> Terminal Output  |
|  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output  |
|                                 |
|  3 (p[0]) <----+-------------+  |
|                |    PIPE     |  |
|  4 (p[1]) >----+-------------+  |
+---------------------------------+
```

#### Step 3: After `fork()`

```c
	if ((pid = fork()) == -1)
	{
		close(p[0]);
		close(p[1]);
		return (-1);
	}
```

The function `fork()` creates a child process. \
On  success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child. \
On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created, and errno  is  set appropriately.

The child process created is an almost exact copy of the parent, which means it **inherits copies of all the parent's file descriptors**. Now both processes have file descriptors pointing to the same pipe.

```
         Parent Process                                   Child Process
+---------------------------------+               +---------------------------------+
| File Descriptors                |               | File Descriptors                |
|  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input   |               |  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input   |
|  1 (STDOUT) -> Terminal Output  |               |  1 (STDOUT) -> Terminal Output  |
|  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output  |               |  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output  |
|                                 |               |                                 |
|                       3 (p[0]) <----+--------+----> 3 (p[0])                      |
|                                     |  PIPE  |                                    |
|                       4 (p[1]) >----+--------+----< 4 (p[1])                      |
+---------------------------------+               +---------------------------------+
```

This is the key to understanding everything that follows. There is only **one pipe**, but now four different file descriptors are pointing to it (2 for read and 2 for write).

#### Step 4: Execution in Parent and Child ('r' mode)

Now the processes diverge and clean up the file descriptors they don't need.

**Inside the Child Process (`pid == 0`):**

```c
	if (pid == 0) // child process
	{
		// 'r' (read) mode: The parent process needs to read the output of the child
		if (type == 'r')
		{
			close(p[0]);
			if (dup2(p[1], STDOUT_FILENO) == -1)
				exit(1);
			close(p[1]);
		}
```

We'd like to **read** from the child process, so the child has to **write** its output to the pipe, and it doesn't need to read from it.

1.  **`close(p[0])`:** The child closes its read end (`fd 3`). This is crucial.

    ```
                         Child Process
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 | File Descriptors                     |
                 |  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input        |
                 |  1 (STDOUT) -> Terminal Output       |
                 |  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output       |
                 |                                      |
    -+--------+----> X (p[0])  -X- CLOSED --            |
     |  PIPE  |                                         |
    -+--------+----< 4 (p[1])                           |
                 +--------------------------------------+
    ```

2.  **`dup2(p[1], STDOUT_FILENO)`:** The child duplicates its write end (`fd 4`) onto its standard output (`fd 1`). Now, anything the child process writes to `stdout` will go into the pipe. \
`fd 4` remains open.

    ```
                         Child Process
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 | File Descriptors                     |
                 |  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input        |
                 |  1 (STDOUT) -> ------------------+   |
                 |  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output   |   |
                 |                                  |   |
    -+--------+----> X (p[0])  -X- CLOSED --        |   |
     |  PIPE  |        (p[1])  == 1 (STDOUT)        |   |
    -+--------+----< 4 <----------------------------+   |
                 +--------------------------------------+
    ```

3.  **`close(p[1])`:** The child no longer needs the original write-end descriptor (`fd 4`) because `fd 1` now points to the same place. It closes it.

    ```
                         Child Process
                 +--------------------------------------+
                 | File Descriptors                     |
                 |  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input        |
                 |  1 (STDOUT) -> ------------------+   |
                 |  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output   |   |
                 |                                  |   |
    -+--------+----> X (p[0])  -X- CLOSED --        |   |
     |  PIPE  |      1 (STDOUT), (p[1]) -X- CLOSED  |   |
    -+--------+----< 1 <----------------------------+   |
                 +--------------------------------------+
    ```

**Inside the Parent Process (`pid > 0`):**

```c
	else // Parent process
	{
		if (type == 'r')
		{
			close(p[1]);
			return (p[0]);
		}
```

The parent wants to *read* the child's output from the pipe, so it doesn't need to write to it.

1.  **`close(p[1])`:** The parent closes its write end (`fd 4`). \
If it didn't, the pipe would remain open for writing, and the parent would never get an "end-of-file" when reading from pipe `p[0]` (read) end, even after the child process finishes.

    ```
             Parent Process
    +---------------------------------+
    | File Descriptors                |
    |  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input   |
    |  1 (STDOUT) -> Terminal Output  |
    |  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output  |
    |                                 |
    |                       3 (p[0]) <----+--------+-
    |                                     |  PIPE  |
    |      -X- CLOSED -X-   4 (p[1]) >----+--------+-
    +---------------------------------+
    ```

2.  **`return (p[0])`:** The parent returns its read-end file descriptor (`fd 3`) to the `main` function (or wherever `ft_popen` was called).

#### Final State

The `main` function in the parent now has `fd 3`, which is the read end of the pipe. The child process (now running the new command, e.g., `ls`) has its `stdout` redirected to the write end of the same pipe.

    ```
             Parent Process                                   Child Process
    +---------------------------------+               +--------------------------------------+
    | File Descriptors                |               | File Descriptors                     |
    |  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input   |               |  0 (STDIN)  <- Terminal Input        |
    |  1 (STDOUT) -> Terminal Output  |               |  1 (STDOUT) -> ------------------+   |
    |  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output  |               |  2 (STDERR) -> Terminal Output   |   |
    |                                 |               |                                  |   |
    |                       3 (p[0]) <----+--------+----> X (p[0])  -X- CLOSED --        |   |
    |                                     |  PIPE  |      1 (STDOUT), (p[1]) -X- CLOSED  |   |
    |      -X- CLOSED -X-   4 (p[1]) >----+--------+----< 1 <----------------------------+   |
    +---------------------------------+               +--------------------------------------+
    ```

This setup is exactly what we need: the parent can now use `read()` (or `get_next_line`) on its file descriptor `fd` to get the output of the `ls` command running in the child process.
